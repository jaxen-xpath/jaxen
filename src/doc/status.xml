      <section title="Changes in CVS since last release">
        <p>There is now an XPath interface in the org.jaxen package to represent any XPath implementation.
          So this means that the XPath API of Jaxen is now polymorphic, the same interface can work with 
          any model.
        </p>
        <p>
           This now means that the org.jaxen.* package represents a purely interface based API to any XPath
           engine. So it should be possible to implement XPath, FunctionContext, NamespaceContext, VariableContext
           on any XPath engine if so desired.
        </p>
        <p>The XPath implementation for each model has now got a fully qualified class name. 
          The following code describes how to instantiate an XPath object for each model.
<pre>
// for DOM
XPath xpath = new DOMXPath( "//foo" );

// for dom4j
XPath xpath = new Dom4jXPath( "//foo" );

// for Electric XML
XPath xpath = new ElectricXPath( "//foo" );

// for JDOM
XPath xpath = new JDOMXPath( "//foo" );
</pre>
        </p>
        <p>The XPath.valueOf() method is now deprecated, XPath.stringValueOf() should be used instead.
        </p>
        <p>Added new extension functions kindly provided by Mark Wilson. They are as follows...
          <ul>
            <li>upper-case() - converts the first argument to an upper case string using either the default Locale or the Locale specified by the second parameter</li>
            <li>lower-case() - converts the first argument to a lower case string using either the default Locale or the Locale specified by the second parameter</li>
            <li>ends-with() - evaluates true if the first string ends with the postfix</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Some auxillary implementation detail changes, which shouldn't affect the public API in any way are as follows
          <ul>
            <li>The org.jaxen.JaXPath class has been removed. Now we have an org.jaxen.XPath interface its no longer required.</li>
            <li>The org.jaxen.expr.XPath class has been renamed to org.jaxen.expr.XPathExpr to avoid confusion and to use a more consistent name.
            Similarly the DefaultXPath class has been renamed to DefaultXPathExpr as well.</li>
            <li>The very confusing jaSelect*() methods have gone from JaXPath and BaseXPath. All evaluation methods can take a Context object, null, a node or a node set.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Initial beta development cycle.  Please see
          CVS changelogs for up-to-date list of changes.

    <section title="To Do List">
      <ul>
        <li>Implement a GenericXPath which could use reflection on the nodes passed into it to
          choose the Navigator to use. So the same GenericXPath instance could be used
          to evaluate XPaths on any object. This feature would be particularly useful
          in <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/doc/standard-doc/intro.html">JSTL</a> 
          since it would allow web developers to mix and match any
          all XML models.
        </li>
        <li>Any Locale sepecific functions, such as <code>upper-case()</code> 
          and <code>lowercase-case()</code> could well follow the example of
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-operators/#func-upper-case">XSLT 2.0</a>
          by using the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr21/">Unicode case mappings</a>
        </li>
        <li>While already Jaxen is pretty 
        <a href="http://dom4j.org/benchmarks/xpath/index.html">fast</a>
        but we are sure it could use some more tuning.
        </li>
        <li>selectSingleNode() and possibly the *ValueOf() methods should be return-fast
          as a performance improvement.
          For example selectSingleNode( "//foo" ) on a document with lots of &lt;foo/&gt;
          elements would actually create a full nodeset of results then extract the first
          element - rather than just returning as soon as the first one is found.
        </li>
        <li>Better user guides and examples!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section title="Known problems">    
      <ul>
        <li>The <code>translate()</code> XPath function needs implementing. Any volunteers?
        </li>
        <li><code>id()</code> function not implemented for most models.</li>
      </ul>

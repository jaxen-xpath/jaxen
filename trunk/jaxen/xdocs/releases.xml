      <p>
The current version is 1.1 beta 10. 
1.1 is a major upgrade that significantly improves jaxen's conformance to the underlying XPath specs. 
Even though it's still officially a beta, this release
is a vast improvement over 1.0, and all users are strongly encouraged to upgrade. 
With a few small exceptions (e.g. the the <code>document()</code> function has moved to the 
<code>org.jaxen.function.xslt</code> package, the <code>IdentityHashMap</code> class has been deleted,
and the ElectricXML navigator has been deleted) 1.1
is backwards compatible with code written to the 1.0 APIs.

      <p>
      Nightly builds have been temporarily suspended as we ramp up
      with using <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>.
      However, you can grab a <a href="http://cvs.jaxen.codehaus.org/">tarball</a> of the current CVS head from FishEye if you like. 
      To build Jaxen, you'll need to have maven installed. Assuming you do you should be able to just type "maven jar" at the command line 
      in the jaxen directory to create a JAR archive. <!-- If any of the tests are currently failing- -a couple of 
      tests are currently picking up JDOM bugs- -you'll need to type "maven -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true jar" instead
      (or fix the bugs that cause the tests to fail). -->

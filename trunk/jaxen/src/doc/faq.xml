    <section title="What is Jaxen?">
      <p>
      The <i>Jaxen</i> project is a Java XPath Engine.
      Jaxen is a universal object model walker, capable of evaluating
      XPath expressions across multiple models.  Currently supported
      are <a href="http://dom4j.org">dom4j</a> and <a href="http://jdom.org">JDOM</a>.

    <section title="What is the Jaxen license?">
      <p>We use an Apache-style open source license which is one of the least
        restrictive licenses around, you can use <i>Jaxen</i> to create new products
        without them having to be open source.

    <section title="Why is Jaxen useful?">
      <p>
        After implementing an XPath engine for both <a href="http://dom4j.org">dom4j</a> and
        <a href="http://jdom.org">JDOM</a>, and attempting to keep them both in sync, it was
        decided that factoring out the commonality would be a Good Thing.  Thus, Jaxen
        provides a single point for XPath expression evaluation, regardless of the target
        object model, whether its <b>dom4j</b>, <b>JDOM</b>, <b>DOM</b>, <b>JavaBeans</b>,
        or whatnot.

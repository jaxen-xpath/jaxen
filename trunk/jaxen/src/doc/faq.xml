    <section title="What is SAXPath?">
      <p>
      The <i>SAXPath</i> project is a Simple API for XPath. 
      SAXPath is analogous to SAX in that the API abstracts away the details of 
      parsing and provides a simple event based callback interface.

    <section title="What is the SAXPath license?">
      <p>We use an Apache-style open source license which is one of the least
        restrictive licenses around, you can use <i>SAXPath</i> to create new products
        without them having to be open source.
      </p>

    <section title="Why is SAXPath useful?">
      <p>
        After implementing an XPath engine for both <a href="http://dom4j.org">dom4j</a> and
        <a href="http://jdom.org">JDOM</a>, and attempting to keep them both in sync, it was
        decided that factoring out the commonality would be a Good Thing.  Thus, SAXPath
        provides a single point for XPath expression parsing, regardless of the target
        object model, whether its <b>dom4j</b>, <b>JDOM</b>, <b>DOM</b>, <b>JavaBeans</b>,
        or whatnot.

    <section title="Is there an implementation?">
      <p>
        The API is open to many implementation, but also included in the
        distribution, currently, is the 
        <a href="http://code.werken.com/">werken digital</a> implementation.
      </p>
    </section> 

    <section title="What can I do with SAXPath?">
      <p>
        Probably the most useful thing to do with SAXPath is to use it
        in conjunction with Jaxen (will link soon to the jaxen.org site).

 * The <b>round</b> function returns the number that is closest to the argument and that is an integer. 
 * If there are two such numbers, then the one that is closest to positive infinity is returned. 
 * If the argument is NaN, then NaN is returned. If the argument is positive infinity, then positive infinity is returned.

 * If the argument is positive zero, then positive zero is returned. 
 * If the argument is negative zero, then negative zero is returned. 
 * If the argument is less than zero, but greater than or equal to -0.5, then negative zero is returned.

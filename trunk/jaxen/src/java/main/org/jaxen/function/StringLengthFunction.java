/**
 * <p><b>4.2</b> <code><i>number</i> string-length(<i>string</i>)</code></p> 
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <b>string-length</b> function returns the number of <strong>Unicode characters</strong>
 * in its argument. This is <strong>not</strong> necessarily 
 * the same as the number <strong>Java chars</strong>
 * in the corresponding Java string. In particular, if the Java <code>String</code>
 * contains surrogate pairs each such pair will be counted as only one character
 * by this function. If the argument is omitted, 
 * it returns the length of the string-value of the context node.

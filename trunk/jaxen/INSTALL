To install Jaxen, you need either:

        jaxen-full.jar

Which includes support for all object-models

Or, you need

        jaxen-core.jar

And any additional jaxen-*.jar files for the object-models
you support.  Currently supported are:

        Model       Required Jar
        ----------- -------------------
        dom4j       jaxen-dom4j.jar
        JDOM        jaxen-jdom.jar
        DOM         jaxen-dom.jar
        EXML        jaxen-exml.jar

Jaxen itself depends upon the SAXPath parser, which is
located in the lib/ directory and is named:

        saxpath.jar

Of course, you'll also need the supporting jars for your 
object-model, just as jdom.jar, EXML.jar, or similar.

Included in the lib/ directory are the jars compiled
against for this distribution.

To install Jaxen, you need to place:

        jaxen-1.1-beta-4.jar

In your CLASSPATH or your jre/lib/ext directory.
This includes support for all object-models.
Of course, you'll also need the supporting jars for your 
object-model, just as jdom.jar, xom.jar, or similar.

Included in the lib/ directory are the jars compiled
against for this distribution.
